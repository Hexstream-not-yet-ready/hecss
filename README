This library makes it easy to build a representation of CSS as lisp objects, which you can then inspect/transform/output.
There is an included optimizer and compiler which produces highly efficient code.

The syntax supports niceties such as hierarchical selectors, property replicators (ex: :margin-lr "auto" means :margin-left "auto" :margin-right "auto") and is very lispy.


It DOES NOT currently include a macro to directly output CSS with lisp code embedded (the model currently used by most lisp CSS libraries). However, I never personally needed such a feature so far.


This library is in the Public Domain.
